# 📊 Impact of Insomnia on Student Academic Performance  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores the relationship between **insomnia (sleep difficulties)** and **student academic performance** using a dataset of student lifestyle and study factors.  
The goal was to analyze **sleeping habits, stress levels, fatigue, screen usage, and physical activity** to understand how they impact **academic outcomes**.  

The analysis was conducted in **Power BI**, with data preprocessing in CSV/Excel.

## 🔍 Dataset  
**File:** `Student Insomnia and Educational Outcomes Dataset.csv`  
- Columns include:  
  - `Gender`  
  - `Year of Study`  
  - `Difficulty of Sleep`  
  - `Sleeping Hours Per Day`  
  - `Stress Level`  
  - `Habits of Screen`  
  - `Physical Activity`  
  - `Study Difficulty`  
  - `Fatigue`  
  - `Rating of Study`

## 📊 Dashboard Features  
The **Power BI Dashboard** provides:  
- **Pie Chart:** Gender vs Difficulty of Sleep  
- **Bar Chart:** Study Difficulty vs Sleep Difficulty  
- **Bar Chart:** Stress Level vs Sleeping Hours  
- **Line Chart:** Study Ratings vs Physical Activity  
- **Clustered Chart:** Gender, Screen Habits, and Fatigue Levels  
- **Slicers/Filters:** Gender, Year of Study, Stress Level, Habits of Screen

## 📈 Key Insights  
- Students who often face **difficulty in sleep (5–6 times a week)** struggle most with studies.  
- **7–8 hours of sleep** reduces stress significantly compared to < 5 hours.  
- **Screen habits** strongly correlate with fatigue.  
- Regular **physical activity** improves study ratings.
